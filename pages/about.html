        <h1>About us</h1><br>
        <h2>Chennai is the third largest fleet of two-wheelers in the country after New Delhi and Bangalore.
            Each house should have one bike. Some houses have more than one bike.
            Very few people have a parking space at their home.
            Some people park in their company's parking garage. So many people park their bikes on public roads..
            Some people are parking in front of their house, someone is parking in front of shops etc.
            These types of parking create so many problems for the public as well as bike owners.
            It creates street congestion, reduces road space to make traffic more congested, and bikes have a theft problem.
            Parkin is an idea that helps to connect the two peoples, 
            the one who had a bike and another one who had a parking place in their home. 
            It helps to reduce the street congestion and also reduce bike theft.
